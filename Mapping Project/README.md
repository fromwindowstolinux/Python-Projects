This program generates interactive web maps with Python. The program combines the core Python building blocks such as conditionals, for-loops, functions, and file processing with the extras of a third-party Python library used to generate beautiful web maps. Building this program has helped me practice the Python core concepts, and I have also learn how to approach and use third-party Python libraries.
